		<description><![CDATA[
			Speed up data transfer from iOS to Apple Watch rate. By default, Apple Watch prioritized Bluetooth connection, which makes transferring of music etc. very slow. NanoFi attempts to make WiFi as default connection. Note that your Apple Watch needs to be connected to local WiFi network (autojoin) for this to work. Please read the description in Settings for more info.<br/><br/>
            
            This package tested to be working on iPhone X iOS 14.3, and with Apple Watch S5 on watchOS 7.3.3. Might or might not work on different combinations.<br/><br/>
