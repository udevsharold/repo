            <b>Unlock iPhone with Apple Watch</b><br/><br/>
            iPhone can use your Apple Watch to unlock when Face ID detects a face with a mask. Your Apple Watch must be nearby, on your wrist, unlocked, and protected by a passcode. Your iPhone must be unlocked with passcode once after these criterion are met.<br/>
            This feature was seen implemented by Apple in iOS 14.5 beta1<br/><br/>
            <b>Features:</b><br/>
            <ul>
            <li>Unlock iPhone with an Apple Watch</li><br/>
            <li>Automatically lock iPhone when Apple Watch no longer authenticated</li><br/>
            <li>Banners when unlocked using Perseus (iOS 14.x)</li><br/>
            </ul>
            <br/>

            NOTE: After installed/upgraded this package, you'll notice that immediately after you might need to enter passcode twice. That's because the AW daemon was killed after installation, and hasn't started yet. Just wait for it to automatically respawn by system (you can verify this from the battery widget).<br/><br/>

            <b>Support X series iPhone on iOS 13+. This package tested to be working on iPhone X iOS 13.5 AND 14.3, and with Apple Watch S5 on watchOS 6.2.8/7.3.3. Might or might not work on different combinations.</b><br/><br/>
